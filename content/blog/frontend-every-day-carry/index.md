## ❤️ I freaking love JS tooling

I am more than happy to burn some CPU cycles locally and preprocess and minimize
the shit out of my code

## JS Frameworks

### Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a super cool open source static site
generator. It allows you to source data from lots of different sources,
manipulate it during the build step, and programmatically create pages based off
the data. After ironing out some kinks in our implementation, we were able to
comfortably scale upwards of 650 pages with fast build times (leveraging
incremental builds on their cloud build & hosting platform).
