# A team starts with it's people.

People come in all shapes and sizes. People have different communication styles,
learning styles and working styles. A multi-discipline team focusing on a wide

target markets — needs hyper-smooth processes and ways of working and a lofty
long-term goal in order to achieve the impossible every day, while still
operating at a sustainable pace.
