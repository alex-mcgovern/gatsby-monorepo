_Hello._ My name is Alex McGovern.

![Chinese Salty Egg](./salty_egg.jpg)

I'm a frontend engineering manager and generalist, with a weird and eclectic mix
of experience.

I'm currently a frontend engineering manager for a B2B marketing site at
hyper-growth fintech startup. It's a really cool job. I've grown to believe that
B2B marketing sites don't have to be boring, and they should be easy to scale,
maintain and localise. I haven't got all the answers yet, but I'm tackling all
the problems that go with the territory and sharing some of my learnings along
the way.

Originally educated in music technology and multimedia, I have a a weird and
eclectic mix of experience, and have worn many hats throughout my career, here
are some of the highlights:

- 🎥 interning as a cameraman & video editor
- 👨🏻‍🎨 interning at small-time brand agencies and print-shops
- 💃 embroidery designer for Irish dance dresses
- 🧴 cosmetics packaging designer
- 🧑‍🔧 developer support
- 🧑‍💻 frontend engineer
- 📲 UX/UI designer
- 👨‍🏫 engineering manager

Nowadays, when I'm at work, I am obsessed with building a building a high
performance engineering team using a blend of lean software development, agile
and clean code. I'm also obsessed with bringing the best parts of these concepts
into all parts of the product design lifecycle to create a truly collaborative
"full-cycle team" — a high throughput and high impact team where proper
prioritization and planning means _everyone_ on the team is working at a
sustainable pace. By creating a mutually beneficial mission (like building an
award winning website) everyone is empowered to do their best work, and put
forward the best ideas to help reach a common goal.

When I'm not at work, I love playing and recording guitar, producing and mixing
electronic music, drawing, painting and tinkering with and upgrading things... I
have even been known to dabble in 3D modelling video game development. In the
past I've also helped run open mic nights, club nights and DJ societies, and
even done quite a bit a of busking. In short, I love playing music and creating
things.

Now that you've read all about me, enjoy a few blog posts that I've put together
on some of my thoughts on building products and processes for scale with an
intentional first approach.

Disclaimer: I am still at the beginning of my journey and my career. I don't
have it all figured out, but maybe something in here is useful to someone, or
interesting to someone else.
