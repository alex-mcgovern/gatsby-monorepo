##### Example project

# Multilingual Pokedex

This is a working example of the engineering task I created for my team. The
brief is to create a multilingual Pokedex, using data from PokeAPI.

The focus is on how the candidate structures their data and how i18n is built
into the design, as well as their approach to i18n functionality in the frontend
and how they render large volumes of data.
