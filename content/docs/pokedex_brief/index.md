##### Example project

# Multilingual Pokedex

This is a working example of the take-home challenge I use for frontend roles.
The brief is to create a static Gatsby website containing a multilingual
Pokedex, using data sourced from PokeAPI at build time.

The focus is on how the candidate structures their data and how i18n is built
into the design, as well as their approach to i18n functionality in the frontend
and how they render large volumes of data.
