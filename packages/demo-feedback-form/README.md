# Feedback form

Simple customer feedback form built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and using [VisX](https://airbnb.io/visx) for data visualisation


## Demo

[Live demo](https://feedback.alexmcgovern.com)


## Features

- Authentication via Firebase Auth
- Create & delete comments via Firestore
- Pagination for Firestore
- Feedback scores visualised with VisX


## What's left to improve & why

### UI improvements

- **Nicer UI component for feedback modal:** Project uses a simple single select for "rating" field in dialog. Ideally would create something more bespoke, and nicer to use â€” e.g. slider.
- **Design system component improvements:** Project uses my own design system, which is still in it's early stages. Could use a lot more test coverage.

### Testing improvements

- **Mock Firebase functions in test environment:** Currently only pagination state and component functionality is tested, while creating & updating Firestore docs is still uncovered. Ideally would mock Firebase using a similar approach as [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firestore-jest-mock).
- **Test Graph component:** Due to some async state updates, feedback graph is empty on initial render. This probably needs to be wrapped in `act(...)`, but due to time constraints, has been left untested.
